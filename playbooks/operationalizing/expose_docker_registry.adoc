OpenShift provides an internal Docker registry for which to serve images for use within the OpenShift environment. It may be desirable to expose this registry for consumption by external entities. This document describes the process of accessing the integrated Docker registry from a source external to the OpenShift environment.

Official documentation on this subject can be found https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/registry/securing_and_exposing_registry.html#exposing-the-registry[here].

== Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required prior to beginning the steps to expose the internal docker repository

* OpenShift Environment
** Secured Integrated Docker registry
** Router with wildcard DNS certificate
* External entity with Docker client installed

== Goals

Expose the integrated OpenShift docker registry and make it accessible from _registry.ose.example.com_

== OpenShift Configuration

During the installation of the integrated Docker registry, the osadm tool creates a service called _docker-registry_ in the default project. OpenShift provides the ability to expose a service to be consumed by external entities through the _oc expose_ command. We will use this command to make the Docker service available externally from OpenShift. Run the following command to expose the integrated docker registry to the hostname _registry.ose.example.com_.

   oc expose service docker-registry –-hostname=registry.ose.example.com

This command will create a route with the same name as the service (docker-registry) by default. Unfortunately, the routes are created as unsecured by default. Since docker expects to communication to occur on a secured channel, we need to configure TLS security on the route. There are three types of TLS termination that can be applied to a route: edge, passthrough and re-encryption. Since the Docker registry is already secured, we will used passthrough termination where the router will not terminate the TLS connection and instead pass the encrypted traffic to the endpoint destination.

Add the following to docker-registry route spec section by adding the following in the editor that is presented when editing the route after invoking `oc edit route docker-registry` command

[source]
----
spec:
  host: registry.ose.example.com
  tls:
    termination: passthrough
  to:
    kind: Service
  name: docker-registry
----

It's worth noting that when a router is created using the *oadm router* command, you have the option of specifying a default certificate to use for all TLS enabled routes. For our environment, we created a wildcard certificate, valid for all hostnames that match \*.apps.ose.example.com as the default cert. You also have the option of creating unique certificates for specific routes you create. You would do this by inserting the certificate contents in the yaml shown above during the *oc edit router* step.

Now that we have our route configured, we will turn our attention to how we will negotiate with the newly exposed registry. Docker registries have the ability to govern who is authorized to push and pull images, and since this registry is a core component of OpenShift, we can utilize OpenShift authorization policies. Normal users can be granted access to interact with the registry, however for this example, we will use a service account. Create a file called _sa.json_ that will create a service account called _dockersvc_ with the following contents:

[source]
----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "ServiceAccount",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "dockersvc"
  }
}

----

Service accounts can be applied at the project level to access images within the scope of a project. Execute the following command while in the desired proejct to add to service account from the _sa.json_ file:

   oc create –f sa.json

When a new service account is created, a token is created as a secret for service accounts to access the integrated registry. The name of this token can be obtained by running the following commnad:

   oc get serviceaccount dockersvc –o yaml

The following is the relevant output from this command:

[source]
----
secrets:
- name: dockersvc-token-8pofm <1>
- name: dockersvc-dockercfg-f44xb

----
<1> This is the name of the secret that will be needed in subsequent actions

To extract the token value, run the following command:

    oc describe secret dockersvc-token-8pofm

The token will be shown in the data section as shown below:

[source]

ca.crt: 1066 bytes

----
<1> This is the value that will be used when configuring the Docker client

== Docker Client Configuration

Docker provides secure communication with TLS encryption support and the Docker client leverages certificates in the /etc/docker/certs.d to communicate with secured registries. Certificates are organized by the address of the registry. Create a folder with the name of the host name created for the route earlier in the _/etc/docker/certs.d_ folder called *registry.ose.example.com*. Copy the ca certificate which was used when the docker registry was secured previously to this folder and rename the file _ca.crt_.

Before we can pull images from the registry, we need to first login to the remote repository. Using the name of the service account and the token value retrieved earlier, execute the following command to log into the registry.

    docker login –u dockersvc –e <any_email> -p <token> registry.ose.example.com

Docker should now be authenticated to the OpenShift registry.
The credentials are now cached in the the _~/.docker/config.json_ file for future invocations.

Images are stored in the integrated registry in the format <project>/<app>. For example, to pull an image for an app called _eap-test_ in the project eap, the following command would be used:

    docker pull registry.ose.example.com/eap/eap-test

The image should now be available on the local system

Since we would want to allow our service account to push and pull images from the OpenShift registry, we want to make sure they are a member of the appropriate roles. For this example application, we will add the service account to the cluster edit role.

Execute the following command to add the cluster edit role to the Jenkins service account:

    oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:<project>:dockersvc

The application if this policy can be confirmed with the following command:

    oc describe clusterPolicyBindings :default

The following is returned from the command
